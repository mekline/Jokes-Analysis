Analysis notes

t_tests_mainpaper.R was used to run over each of the files in contrasts/ to produce the by-parcel t tests for each localizer that are reported in the supplemental materials tables. The results are concatenated together in t_tests_all.csv, and made pretty in tables_of_t_tests.xlsx

figs_mainpaper.R again reads in all the relevant contrast files, but then produces a bunch of pretty graphs!  This one is set up to produce ALL the graphs and can be rerun at will.

contains nicely formatted versions of the corresponding results csvs that are produced by spm_ss. They were created by load_spmss_results.R and can be reproduced by making sure all your directories are set correctly and then running that file (for each result set, e.g. LHLangrespJokes) 

The interpretation of ROI number and contrast number depend on the settings that were provided during the toolbox run.  You can see the scripts that actually produced the raw spm_ss results over in the Toolbox Results folders.  Meanwhile, important numbers recorded here for easy access:

The contrasts are numbered and depend on what was specified in the toolbox script:
- all …respNonlitJokes have three critical contrasts: {'joke','lit','joke-lit'}
- the …respCustomJokes have four: {'low','med','high','other'}

(remember that contrasts with only 1 category labeled are versus fixation)

The ROIs are numbered and depend on the localizer parcels:

***Language localizer (and RH analogues; numbered the same way)

1	LPostTemp	RPostTemp
2	LAntTemp	RAntTemp
3	LAngG		RAngG
4	LIFG		RIFG
5	LMFG		RMFG
6	LIFGorb		RIFGorb

And they are traditionally displayed in the order [5 4 6 2 3 1]

***ToM localizer
1	DMPFC
2	LTPJ
3	MMPFC
4	PC
5	RTPJ
6	VMPFC
7	RSTS

***MD Localizer
1	LIFGop
2	RIFGop
3	LMFG
4	RMFG
5	LMFGorb
6	RMFGorb
7	LPrecG
8	RPrecG
9	L Insula
10	R Insula
11	LSMA
12	RSMA
13	L ParInf
14	R ParInf
15	L ParSup
16	R ParSup
17	L ACC
18	R ACC

To display the MD localizers by hemisphere, use [1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17] for 
left and [2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18] for right
