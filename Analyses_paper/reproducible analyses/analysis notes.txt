Analysis notes

All analyses in these folders are based on the cleaned-up csv files in ../contrasts/, which has all signal changes for all contrasts/all fROIs/all participants for the named analysis (e.g. RHLangfROIsrespJokes)

/figs/
export dir for all figures 

t_tests_mainpaper.R was used to run over each of the files in contrasts/ to produce the by-parcel t tests for each localizer that are reported in the supplemental materials tables. The results are concatenated together in t_tests_all.csv, and made pretty in tables_of_t_tests.xlsx

figs_mainpaper.R again reads in all the relevant contrast files, but then produces a bunch of pretty graphs!  This one is set up to produce ALL the graphs and can be rerun at will.
